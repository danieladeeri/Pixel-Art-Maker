# Pixel Art Maker

The entire project is done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## CRITERIA SPECIFICATIONS

**JavaScript Loops and Functions**

Upon the user submitting the grid size, the function makeGrid() successfully displays the grid on the screen dynamically using While and For Loops.

**JavaScript Selectors and Event Listeners**

The code uses selectors to get DOM elements and user input values. The code uses event listeners to trigger grid creation, open up a color-picker, and modify the grid colors.
